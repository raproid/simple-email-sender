# Simple email sender
A simple email sender written in PHP.

## Install

Clone the repo to a chosen directory and switch to it: 
`git clone git@github.com:raproid/simple-email-sender.git && cd simple-email-sender`

## Deploy and run

### macOS

1. Edit the content of the file according to your needs.

2. Deploy an instance of the default PHP server:
`php -S localhost:9000`

3. Run the script opening `localhost:9000` in an Internet browser of your choice. This effectively opens the index.php file and executes the logic inside it, i.e. sends an email. Every page refresh repeats the action.


## Troubleshooting

Refer to the [PHP mail function documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php) in case of any errors.
